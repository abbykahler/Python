Stand in a quarter-squat position (a shallow squat), with your feet about hip-width apart, and your hands at your chest or on your hips. Take a step to the right with your right foot, so that your feet are wider than hip width.

            {% comment %} <p>Loop a mini band around your ankles and stand with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. With your hands at your chest or on your hips, shift all your weight into your left leg and place your right toes on the floor about an inch diagonally behind your left heel, so there is tension in the band. Squeeze your core and tuck your pelvis under as you kick your right leg back about 6 inches. Keep your knee straight. Return your right foot to tap the floor, keeping tension in the band, for 1 rep.</p> {% endcomment %}

Bend your knees a few inches and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your abs engaged and glutes tight. Take one step forward. That’s 1 rep. Take 10 steps forward and immediately take 10 steps back. That’s 20 reps. (If you are doing the shorter workout option, complete for 45 seconds.)</p> {% endcomment %}

            {% comment %} <p>Loop a mini band above your knees around both thighs. Lie on your right side and prop up your head with your right hand. Bend both knees and bend at the hip so your thighs are perpendicular to your hip. Keeping your feet together, elevate your feet to hip height, while your knees stay touching the floor. Keep your feet together as you lift your top knee (your left knee) toward the ceiling.Slowly lower your left knee down to return to your starting position. That’s 1 rep.
