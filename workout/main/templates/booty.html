Jump your feet out and in for 1 rep, keeping a bent knee position throughout and landing softly each time.</p> {% endcomment %}

            {% comment %} <p>Place the band around your ankles. Stand in a quarter-squat position (a shallow squat), with your feet about hip-width apart, and your hands at your chest or on your hips. Take a step to the right with your right foot, so that your feet are wider than hip width. Follow with your left foot so that your feet are hip-width apart again.Take three steps to the right, and then three back to the left. Thatâ€™s 1 rep.</p> {% endcomment %}

            {% comment %} <p>Loop a mini band around your ankles and stand with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. With your hands at your chest or on your hips, shift all your weight into your left leg and place your right toes on the floor about an inch diagonally behind your left heel, so there is tension in the band. Squeeze your core and tuck your pelvis under as you kick your right leg back about 6 inches. Keep your knee straight. Return your right foot to tap the floor, keeping tension in the band, for 1 rep.</p> {% endcomment %}
