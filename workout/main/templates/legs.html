            <p>Stand with your feet together, holding a weight in each hand in front of your legs.</p>
            <p>Shift your weight to your left leg and, while keeping a slight bend in your left knee, raise your right leg straight behind your body, hinging at the hips to bring your torso parallel to the floor, and lower the weight toward the floor. (You may need to bend your knee a bit more depending on your hip mobility and hamstring flexibility.)</p>
            <p>Keep your back flat. At the bottom of the movement, your torso and right leg should be almost parallel to the floor, with the weight a few inches off the ground. (If your hamstrings are tight, you may not be able to reach as far down.)
            </p>
            <p>Keeping your core tight, push through your left heel to stand up straight and pull the weight back up to the starting position. Bring your right leg back down to meet your left. Pause there and squeeze your butt.</p>
            <p>Step back (about 2 feet) into a reverse lunge with your right foot, landing on the ball of your right foot and keeping your heel off the ground. Bend both knees to create two 90-degree angles with your legs.</p>
            <p>Push through the heel of your left foot to return to standing. Thatâ€™s 1 rep.</p>
