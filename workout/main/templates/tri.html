            {% comment %} <p>Stand with your feet about hip-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand behind your neck, elbows bent and pointing toward the ceiling. Press the weights together so they are touching, and pull your elbows in as close to your head as you can. This is the starting position. weights are in the air. This is the starting position.</p>
            <p>Without moving your upper arms, straighten your elbows and extend the weights directly overhead. Keep your shoulders down, your core tight, and your arms as close to your head as possible.</p>
            <p>Pause for a second, and then slowly lower the weights back down behind your head. This is 1 rep.</p> {% endcomment %}
