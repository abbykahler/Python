            {% comment %} <p>Grab a pair of dumbbells and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. Hinge forward from your hips to lower your chest toward the floor, arms hanging directly from your shoulders, and palms facing toward body. Brace your core, then pull the weights toward your rib cage, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Pause, then lower back to start. That’s one rep</p>
